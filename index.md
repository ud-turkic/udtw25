# 2nd Workshop on Universal Dependencies for Turkic Languages

As a follow-up to the [2023 workshop in Istanbul](https://ud-turkic.github.io/udtw23/), this workshop aims to bring together researchers working on [Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/) (UD) treebanks for [Turkic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages).

The workshop will be held as a half-day session at [SyntaxFest 2025](https://syntaxfest.github.io/syntaxfest25/) in Ljubljana on August 26, 2025. We will also facilitate online participation.

## Focus Areas

The primary focus of the workshop will be on _consistent_ annotations of several phenomena that have been discussed in the community since the Istanbul meeting, particularly:

- The annotation of the "-ki suffix"
- Copular constructions, for which concrete proposals have been produced by community members

We are also interested in exploring other linguistic phenomena in Turkic languages that present challenges for annotation within the current [UD guidelines](https://universaldependencies.org/guidelines.html).

## Additional Topics

We welcome contributions on:

- New treebanks for Turkic languages
- Linguistic research conducted using the treebanks
- Applications of treebanks for research and practical purposes

## Program

TBD
