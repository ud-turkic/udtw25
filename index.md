As a follow-up to
[2023 workshop in Istanbul](https://ud-turkic.github.io/udtw23/),
this workshop aims to bring together people working on
[Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/) (UD)
treebanks
for [Turkic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages).
The workshop will be held as a half-day workshop
at [SyntaxFest 2025](https://syntaxfest.github.io/syntaxfest25/)
in Ljubljana on 26 August 2025.
We also aim to facilitate online participation.

The focus of the workshop will be _consistent_ annotations
of a number of phenomena that has been discussed in the community
since the Istanbul meeting,
in particular the annotation of "-ki suffix"
and copular constructions where there are concrete proposals
produced by the members of the community.
We are also interested in other linguistic phenomena in Turkic languages
that are not easy (or elegant) to annotate with the current
[UD guidelines](https://universaldependencies.org/guidelines.html).

Other topics, new treebanks for Turkic languages,
(linguistic) research done on the treebanks,
and other use of treebanks for research and practical applications, are welcome.

The workshop is supported by [COST action CA21167](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA21167/): Universality, diversity and idiosyncrasy in language technology (UniDive).
